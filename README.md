# Linear Analysis Toolkit

Introduction:

This programming project consists of code written in Matlab to perform linear elastic analysis of three-dimensional frame element structures.  The user specifies all the input information using the MASTAN2 graphical user interface (GUI) and preprocessor. The program handles free, fixed, and displacement specified support conditions; prismatic beam-column elements including flexural and shear deformations; concentrated nodal forces specified in global coordinates; and uniform member loads defined in the member coordinate system. The program does not handle members with moment releases.
